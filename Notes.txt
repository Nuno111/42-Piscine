c02 ex10 needs reviewing. Do I need to check for null characters?! Do i need to fill empty buffers with null characters?!

c02 ex11 should be correct but better double check

c02 ex12 Skipped  for now.

C03 ex05 total mess needs clearing up whats expected!
C03 ex05, strlen function will return size in case the string was not null terminated while i < size
like the manual implies, thats why we have to pass the size paramter to it

c05 ex08 skipped, need help to solve this puzzle..
